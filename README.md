# nski

## History

Originally a static html wrapper for mski Tampere.

I got pissed at mski for

 - Not showing when the status of an ice was last updated
 - Needing an extra click every time opening the page

So I made a wrapper for it.

It's ugly, it only supports Tampere and ice skating, but it does everything I need.

## Today

Mski was replaced by sometec, which, while
a little UX friendlier, now uses POST requests to
fetch data from a server with no regards to CORS.
This means nski now needs a backend.
